OpenLayers.Control.MouseToolbar

Control to set up mouse handling. This includes clicks, double clicks, scrollwheel events, and mouse movement. There are a number of functions which act as the default handlers for these events: if you wish to create your own mouse control which behaves differently, you should create a subclass of MouseToolbar, replacing the functions whose behavior you wish to change. Additionally, a toolbar of images can be clicked to start events, as well as using the keyboard shortcuts.

* Constructor
  OpenLayers.Control.MouseToolbar({OpenLayers.Pixel|position}, {String|direction}) -- Creates a new control. The direction of the control can be either "vertical" or "horizontal". The default is vertical.

* Methods
  defaultClick -- none -- This event takes place when a click event occurs on the map.
  defaultDblClick -- none -- This event re-centers the map on the clicked location.
  defaultMouseDown -- none -- This event starts a dragging event, so that the map can be dragged. If the shift key is held, it starts a 'zoombox' or rubber-band-zoom action instead.
  defaultMouseMove -- none -- If a mouseDrag is in operation, this function causes the map to move to follow the cursor. If a zoombox is in place, this increases the size of the zoombox element to match the cursor.
  defaultMouseUp -- none -- This function is called when a mouseup event is received, and either sets the center of the map to be the final location or zooms to the zoombox if enabled.
  defaultMouseOut -- none -- This calls defaultMouseUp, so that when you mouse out of the map div, the events are stopped.
