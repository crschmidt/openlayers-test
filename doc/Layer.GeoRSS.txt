OpenLayers.Layer.GeoRSS

GeoRSS layer. Pass a name and location of a GeoRSS file on the web, and a marker will be added to the map for each item in the GeoRSS feed. Uses OpenLayers.loadURL to load the XML, parses the data, and adds markers to the map. The GeoRSS layer supports 1.0 and 2.0 in IE and Firefox, and supports 2.0 in Safari. (Ticket #111 explains the reason for this difference.)


* Constructor
  OpenLayers.Layer.GeoRSS(name, url) -- Name and location of GeoRSS XML file.

* Methods

  markerClick(Event) -- none -- Action to perform when a marker is clicked.
  clearFeatures() -- none -- Removes all features and markers from the map.
