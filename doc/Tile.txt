OpenLayers.Tile

This is a class designed to designate a single tile, however
it is explicitly designed to do relatively little. Tiles store information
about themselves -- such as the URL that they are related to, and their 
size - but do not add themselves to the layer div automatically, for 
example.

* Constructor
  OpenLayers.Tile({OpenLayers.Layer|layer}, {OpenLayers.Pixel|position}, {OpenLayers.Bounds|bounds}, {String|url}, {OpenLayers.Size|size}) -- Create a new tile, with properties passed.
