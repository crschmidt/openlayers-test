OpenLayers.Control.LayerSwitcher

This control will by default display a small image in the upper right corner of the map. When clicked, this image expands into a control which allows one to select between multiple types of layers, seperated into two types: Base Layers and Overlays. Only one base layer can be selected at a time, and is enforced by a radio button control being used. Multiple overlays can be selected at once, and a checkbox control is visible for this functionality.
* Constructor
  OpenLayers.Control.LayerSwitcher({Object|options}?) -- Creates a new control.

* Methods

* Parameters
  position -- (inherited from {OpenLayers.Control}) {OpenLayers.Pixel} to use as the top-left corner of the control div, relative to the map area.
  activeColor -- The color to use for the background of the layer switcher div.
