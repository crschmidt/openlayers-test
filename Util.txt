OpenLayers.Util

Utility class. Stores a bunch of methods and settings that don't fit anywhere else.

* Options

 OpenLayers.Util.onImageLoadErrorColor -- A string to set img.style.backgroundColor to if the onerror event fires for the image (useful for 500 errors from WMS, for example). 
 OpenLayers.ImgPath -- A string to be used as the base for images for controls and the like. Should end with '/'.
