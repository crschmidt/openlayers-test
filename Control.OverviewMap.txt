OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap

This control provides a locator or overview map linked to another map. By default, the overview map shows up in the lower right of the main map and can be expdaned with the '+' button.

* Constructor
  OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap(opts?) -- Creates a new overview map. The opts variable is an object with various options, as described in the options section below.
  
* Methods
isSuitableOverview() -- {Boolean} -- Determines if the overview map is suitable given the extent and resolution of the main map.
getRectPxBounds() -- {OpenLayers.Bounds|bounds} -- An OpenLayers.Bounds which is the extent rectangle's pixel bounds (relative to the parent element).
setRectPxBounds({OpenLayers.Bounds|bounds}) -- none -- Set extent rectangle pixel bounds.
getRectBoundsFromMapBounds({OpenLayers.Bounds|lonLatBounds}) -- {OpenLayers.Bounds|bounds} -- An OpenLayers.Bounds which is the passed-in map lon/lat extent translated into pixel bounds for the overview map.
getMapBoundsFromRectBounds({OpenLayers.Bounds|pxBounds]}) -- {OpenLayers.Bounds|bounds} -- An OpenLayers.Bounds which is the passed-in overview rect bounds translated into lon/lat bounds for the overview map.
getLonLatFromOverviewPx({OpenLayers.Pixel|pixel}) -- {OpenLayers.LonLat|lonlat} -- An OpenLayers.LonLat which is the passed-in overview map OpenLayers.Pixel translated into lon/lat by the overview map.
getOverviewPxFromLonLat({OpenLayers.LonLat|lonlat}) -- {OpenLayers.Pixel|pixel} -- An OpenLayers.Pixel which is the passed-in OpenLayers.LonLat, translated into overview map pixels


* Events
  * Rectangle events
They are defined on OverviewMap.rectEvents
	
  mouseover -- rectangle is moused over
  mouseout -- rectangle is no longer mousedout
  mousemove -- mouse moves inside rectangle
  mousedown -- mouse button is pressed over the rectangle.
  mouseup -- mouse button is released over the rectangle.
  click -- mouse clicked
  dblclick -- mouse double clicked
	
  * Map events
	They are defined on OverviewMap.mapDivEvents
	
  click -- mouse clicked	
  
* Options:
  * minRatio -- The ratio of the overview map resolution to the main map resolution at which to zoom farther out on the overview map.
  * maxRatio -- The ratio of the overview map resolution to the main map resolution at which to zoom farther in on the overview map.
  * layers -- Ordered list of layers in the overview map.  If none, then the map base layer is used.
